# python-challenge
Two tasks completed - analyze election data in pypoll and financial data in pybank both from imported csv files.
In pybank we are looking at the total months, net profit/loss, the average change, and identifying the periods with the greatest increase and decrease in profits. 
In pypoll calculations were made to analyze the results of an election between 3 candidates and concluded the winner and the remaining candidates of the election each displayed with the total number of votes and percentage won of total votes that were cast.
